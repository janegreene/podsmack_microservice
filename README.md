# Podsmack Microservice

## Background and Description
This is the Sinatra microservice paired with a Ruby on Rails application used to organize Podcast content by location and topics of interest. Learning goals from this project were to design an application from the ground up, consume a JSON API, authenticate users with OAuth, utilize a service-oriented architecture, and configure continuous integration.
